# APITest
A test GUI application to pull data from Riot API
The programs currently consists of 2 main parts:
=> Form1 which is the main form, where you can type a summoner name and choose the region to search in and the program would
 fetch details about the summoner instantaneously and real-time.
 
=> CurrentMatch form where the current match played by the summoner you fetched can be seen, displaying all current players in the form of cards, each with their name, champion, rank and runes chosen for the match.
